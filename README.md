Kanbanery for Intellij
======================
It's a simple plugin to enable interaction between Kanbanery and IntelliJ Tasks.



Janbanery, the fluent Kanbanery API Connector
=============================================
**Janbanery** is my Fluent Kanbanery API Wrapper. It made this plugin, and a lot more possible, such as...
the <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=pl.project13.kanbanery&feature=search_result">Kanbanery for Android</a> client for example :-)

It's open source and being kept up to date as much as possible, you can clone it from this repo: <a href="https://github.com/ktoso/janbanery">https://github.com/ktoso/janbanery</a>
